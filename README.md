This is a quick app to test new things:
* Next.JS
* MobX
* react-three-fiber

Right now it renders a mix of a r3f tutorial (cubes), a personal project (kicker) and a heightmap generated from data from the French IGN.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
